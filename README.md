## Python

### PyCrypto - 
    The Python cryptographic library [PyCrypto](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto)
    contains C implementations of cryptographic algorithms wrapped in a Python
    interface. Includes implementations of cryptographic algorithms for shared key
    and public key encryption and authentication, cryptographic hashes, and key
    derivation. Also provides a secure PRNG, a strong  version of Python's random
    module, and a small set of useful mathematical operations.
    The latest version of PyCrypto is 2.6.1 (released on Oct 14, 2013). It is
    available for installation through the
    [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycrypto/2.6.1) package manager for Python.
