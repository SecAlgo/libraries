## [Python](Python/)


#### PyCrypto 
C implementations of cryptographic algorithms wrapped in a Python
interface. Includes implementations of cryptographic algorithms for shared key
and public key encryption and authentication, cryptographic hashes, and key
derivation. Also provides a secure PRNG, a strong version of Python's random
module, and a small set of useful mathematical operations.

Latest version: 2.6.1 (10/14/2013).
