management built on top of lower-level libraries. Designed to provide safe and
easy access to cryptographic resources. All configuration is done through key
generation, which is accomplished through an included command-line tool.

#### M2Crypto

Python interface built on top of the OpenSSL cryptographic library (written in
C). Provides access to a wide range of basic cryptographic operations as well
as SSL/TLS, HTTPS, S/MIME, X.509 Certificate management, etc.

#### PyCrypto 

Python library of cryptographic algorithms implemented in C.
Includes cryptographic algorithms for shared key and public key 
encryption and authentication, cryptographic hashes, and key derivation. 
Also provides a secure PRNG, a strong version of Python's random
module, and a small set of useful mathematical operations.

- Developer: [Dwayne Litzenberger](https://www.dlitz.net/)
- Initial Release: 11/11/2002
- Latest version: 2.6.1 (10/14/2013).
- Languages: Python

#### PyCryptodome

Python library of cryptographic algorithms, partially implemented in C. Began as
a fork of PyCrypto. Continued development has added support for authenticated
encryption, safe stream ciphers, elliptic curve operations (encryption and
signing), SHA3 hash functions, etc.

- Developer: [Helder Eijs (Legrandin)](https://github.com/Legrandin)
- Initial Release: 6/24/2014
- Latest version: 3.5.1 (03/07/2018)

#### pyNaCl

A Python interface for the libsodium cryptographic library (written in C), a
fork of the Networking and Cryptography Library (NaCl). Libsodium (and NaCl) are
designed to provide easy access to a carefully selected set of cryptographic
algorithms implemented for saftey and efficiency. The pyNaCl interface provides
similarly high-level access to those resources from within the Python language.

- Initial Release: 04/14/2013
- Latest version: 1.2.1 (12/04/2018)

#### pyOpenSSL

A lightweight Python interface for a subset of the OpenSSL cryptographic
library (written in C). Does not provide general access to basic cryptographic
operations, but instead focuses on the construction of SSL/TLS sessions and the
lower-level cryptographic operations required to manage them (public key 
authentication and X.509 certificate handling).

- Developer: [Python Cryptographic Authority (PyCA)](https://github.com/orgs/pyca/people)
- Initial Release: 07/16/2001
- Latest version: 17.5.0 (11/30/2017)
- Languages: Python
- License: [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/blob/master/LICENSE)

#### pysodium

A lightweight interface wrapped around the libsodium cryptographic library
(written in C), a fork of the Networking and Cryptography library (NaCl). This
is practically a repoduction of the lower-level NaCl interface for cryptographic
operations slightly adapted for usage in Python.

- Developer: [Stefan Marsiske](https://www.ctrlc.hu/~stef/blog/)
